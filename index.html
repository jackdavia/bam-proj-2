			<cite>—London Evening Standard</cite>
		</blockquote>
		<p>In this trailblazing work directed by the inventive Swiss duo Zimmermann & de Perrot, seven performers inhabit a topsy-turvy world where, at any moment, the ceiling can become a floor, a floor can become a wall, and a door can become a chasm. A gigantic, rotating four-room box is the dizzying place where these loose-limbed actors, dancers, and acrobats dodge falling furniture and tumble their way to acrobatic virtuosity, always with impeccable timing. Conceived by choreographer Martin Zimmermann and composer Dimitri de Perrot, who performs his ecstatic original score, Hans was Heiri offers a hilarious portrait of human relationships conveyed through a witty scenic language all its own.</p>

		</blockquote>
		<p>Terrifying, yet seductive. Blood-thirsty harbingers of death who extend a twisted promise of immortality. The vampire figure has long been defined by Bram Stoker’s classic interpretation, Dracula. In Nosferatu, Poland’s TR Warszawa and Teatr Narodowy dig beneath that veneer to deliver a deeply hypnotic, visually sumptuous new take on the vampire legend. Set to an unnerving score by downtown fixture John Zorn, director Grzegorz Jarzyna’s production suspends us in a liquid-green world of shadowy set pieces, brimming with eroticism, while returning to the legend’s deep reflections on fear and the human need for transgression.</p>

		<h4 class="main-credit">Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art</h4>
		<h4 class="main-credit">Written and directed by Alexandre Singh</h4>
		<p>Theater, music, sculpture, Nesquik bunnies, Greco-Roman masks, and a gigantic mountain find common cause in this irreverent performance work by the award-winning British visual artist Alexandre Singh. A boldly original concept that started as an installation piece at the Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art in Rotterdam and evolved into a full-fledged theatrical account of the universe’s creation, The Humans comes to BAM in its culminating chapter: a deliciously indecent mixed-media account of Man’s fall from grace.</p>
		<p>Modeled on the comic writings of Aristophanes and set at the dawn of time and space, The Humans tells the tale of two spirits named Tophole and Pantalingua, who would rather the Earth not be created at all. In a battle against the egomaniacal Creator, they conspire their way to an accidental Paradise Lost, ultimately corrupting the eponymous humans—portrayed as a songful and statuesque Greek chorus—into the flawed mortals we are today.</p>

		<p>In a beautiful theatrical reverie, director David Farr joins forces with Filter Theatre to present an exquisitely crafted story that reveals how the cracks in our most intimate human relationships resonate on a global scale.</p>
		<p>Set beneath a vertical lake of light, ebbing from lavender to cerulean blue, Water intertwines two deeply personal dramas, both cast in the shadow of the struggle against climate change. Buoyed by live music and real-time video, this deft, dreamlike rendering of the personal and political asks how we can reach beyond ourselves and bond, like water, with those around us.</p>

		<h4 class="main-credit">Directed by Paul Lazar</h4>
		<p>Inspired by the two teenage years visual artist Suzanne Bocanegra spent in a body cast due to scoliosis, Bodycast is an inventive theatricalization of the ubiquitous “artist talk.” Part performance and part essay, Bocanegra uses the format to explore how and why she became an artist. It is a sequel of sorts to Bocanegra’s work When a Priest Marries a Witch, which used a similar approach to explore her Texas upbringing and had its premiere in 2010 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Upon viewing that earlier work, Academy Award-winning actor Frances McDormand suggested an artistic collaboration to Bocanegra. Exploring topics as disparate as Roman art, Rose queens, and Texas drill teams, Bodycast mines specific details of Bocanegra’s life to create a more general meditation on art-making and shifting ideals of feminine beauty. Singer Theo Bleckmann and dancer Emily Coates will make guest appearances in the work.</p>

		<p>“Water, water everywhere.” Fiona Shaw delivers a masterful performance of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s eerie tale of penance paid on the high seas. Like an actor possessed, the fiery Shaw inhabits the very marrow of this epic 18th-century poem, bounding across the stage while transforming Coleridge’s luminous language into an exhilarating lived experience.
		In the icy Antarctic, a ship is lost at sea. And when a mariner shoots a bird thought to be the crew’s salvation, his macabre, guilt-inducing fate—the veritable “albatross around the neck”—is decided. Accompanied by dancer Daniel Hay Gordon, who offers interpretive counterpoint throughout, Shaw skirts a whirlpool, braves a crew of corpses, and rolls Death’s dice with poetic abandon, taking us to hell and back.</p>

		<p>To sleep. To dream. In Shakespeare’s Hamlet, we confront the most fundamental questions of our humanity. But what exactly do we confront when the play is shuffled, reordered, and rewritten by a computer?</p>
		<p>In this daring marriage of live acting and artificial intelligence, Obie Award-winning director Annie Dorsen delivers a provocative parsing of Shakespeare’s work. Based on a sophisticated algorithm that generates a new version of the play nightly—words, visuals, lighting, music, and all—A Piece of Work features one actor, alternating between Obie winner Scott Shepherd (Elevator Repair Service’s Gatz, The Wooster Group’s Hamlet) and theater legend Joan MacIntosh, a looming computer screen, and a chorus of synthesized voices channeling this uncanny text, refashioned in the automated image of our digital times.</p>

		<p>Brian Brooks is a daring choreographer, concocting precise, kinetic, and volatile sequences of movement that test the threshold of physical endurance. In Run Don’t Run, Brooks (recently awarded a 2013 Guggenheim Fellowship) employs rapid-fire partnering to explore the spatial contradictions of bodies in motion. Behind a blur of color—created by hundreds of cloth strands stretched across the stage—dancers ricochet off one another in a strobe-like flurry of actions: captured, suspended, and broken apart.

		<p>In this provocative new work, Kate Weare—the BAM Fisher’s first artist-in-residence—looks to sexual fantasy as a metaphor for creative expression, using the stage as a place where we can perform as the most potent, desiring versions of ourselves.</p>
		<p>An original cello score by Chris Lancaster ushers us into this suggestive realm, fetishized and electrified by Weare’s sensual, aggressively intertwined movement vocabulary. Brilliantly attuned to each individual dancer’s quirks and complex identities, Weare orchestrates a series of duets, solos, and trios that explore exposure, self-censorship, and vulnerability, examining how—in the safest, most indeterminate spaces—bodies offer up secrets of their inner life.</p>

		<p>In this mammoth dance-theater work, choreographer Angelin Preljocaj explores the apocalypse as a revelatory event that lays bare the hidden truths of our being.</p>
		<p>Backed by influential DJ Laurent Garnier’s throbbing electronic music, mixed with samples of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, Ballet Preljocaj hurtles through history, impelled by the mysterious fires of passion and belief. On a set designed by renowned Indian artist Subodh Gupta, the dancers (wearing costumes by Russian fashion designer Igor Chapurin) alternate intense, slashing gestures with graceful classical ballet, evoking historical visions of life and death, angels and demons, and Edenic calm and chaos that have, for centuries, kept us clamoring for redemption. Tossed about by these rituals, the dancers float adrift, fearing the end but always struggling for peace.</p>

		<p>Israeli-born, UK-based choreographer Hofesh Shechter’s highly visceral, theatrical dance pieces pair explosive, almost primal movement with the exhilarating sounds and smoky atmosphere of a rock concert. A former dancer with Ohad Naharin’s Batsheva Dance Company, Shechter and his company have performed sold-out shows at Sadler’s Wells in London and to packed houses in Paris, Sydney, and Tokyo.</p>
		<p>This season, he returns to BAM with Sun, a brand-new work featuring an expanded company of 14 dancers and an eclectic soundtrack that includes original music by Shechter himself.</p>

		<p>In an electric guitar-fueled evening of postmodern dance-theater, Susan Marshall couples her intimate, structured choreography with the seductiveness of pop culture to explore our complex relationship to the media we consume.<p>
		<p>Referencing the dance moves and sleek production values of popular music videos, Marshall’s choreography adds nuance to that high-gloss aesthetic while stripping away its context, rendering it both more profound and strange. A commissioned score by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer David Lang—performed live by members of guitar quartet Dither and Mantra Percussion—animates this dialogue between the real and the virtual, in which bodies hover somewhere in between.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>“…one of this country’s most talented choreographers…”</p>
			<cite>—The New York Times</cite>
		</blockquote>
		<p>A master choreographer and interpreter of movement traditions from the African diaspora, Reggie Wilson refracts elements of blues, slave, and spiritual cultures through postmodern structures to create his “post-African/neo-HooDoo” style.</p>
		<p>In Moses(es), he examines the many representations of Moses in religious texts—and in the mythical, canonical, and ethnographic imaginations—to ask: how do we lead and why do we follow? Inspired by Zora Neale Hurston’s vernacular retelling in Moses, Man of the Mountain, Wilson traveled to Israel, Egypt, Turkey, and Mali to consider the migration of African people throughout the world. The result is this rich evening-length work—choreographed for nine performers and set to live vocalizations from the African diaspora and beyond—that unflinchingly questions leadership and our complex relationship to the Moses story.</p>

		<p>Marking the culmination of a two-year endeavor, choreographer Tere O’Connor collapses three of his dance works—Secret Mary, based on themes of authorship and agency; poem, a study in formalism, artifice, and complexity; and Untitled, a duet about the minutiae of personality—into a single hybrid creation. With each piece lending its own unique dancers, ideas, and approaches, Bleed forms a serendipitous new choreographic language. Meanings multiply through the layering, blending, and erasure of elements from each work, and in the choreographic threshold between process and product, craft and coincidence, a poetic logic is revealed.</p>

		<p>In this beautiful, audacious merging of Japanese manga imagery, texts from traditional Noh theater, electronic sounds, and new music sung by the Latvian Radio Choir, War Sum Up ponders the essence of war.</p>
		<p>Twelve bodies, shadow-dappled and anonymous, stand on a looming stage. They inhabit a scarred two-dimensional world, trapped behind projections of images of combat: an explosion, a suit of armor, a hand turning into a gun. Amid this stylized tableau are lush, dissonant chorales by Latvian composer Santa Ratniece, alternating with crackling soundscapes by British electronic pop group the Irrepressibles, intoning hymns to the warrior, spy, and soldier.</p>
